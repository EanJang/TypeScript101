## Generator in Typescript or Javascript

In JavaScript and TypeScript, a generator is a special kind of function that can be used to control the iteration of a loop or sequence.
Unlike normal functions that run to completion and return a value, a generator can pause execution at any point and yield a value to the caller.
When the generator is called again, it resumes execution from where it left off and continues until it reaches another yield statement or completes.
Generators are defined using the function\* syntax in JavaScript and TypeScript.
Here's an example of a simple generator that yields a sequence of numbers:

```javascript
function* numberSequence() {
  let i = 1;
  while (true) {
    yield i++;
  }
}

// Example usage:
const sequence = numberSequence();

console.log(sequence.next().value); // Output: 1
console.log(sequence.next().value); // Output: 2
console.log(sequence.next().value); // Output: 3
```

In this example, the numberSequence function is a generator that uses a while loop to generate an infinite sequence of numbers.
Each time the yield statement is reached, the current value of i is returned to the caller as a result of the next() method.
When the next() method is called again, execution resumes where it left off, starting with the next value of i.

Generators can be used for a wide variety of purposes, including lazy evaluation of sequences, stateful iteration, and asynchronous programming.
Because generators can be paused and resumed at any point, they can be used to implement complex control flows that would be difficult to express using regular functions or callbacks.
