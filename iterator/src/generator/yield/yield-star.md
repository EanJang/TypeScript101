### yield\* Keyword in TypeScript

In TypeScript, the `yield*` keyword is used in generator functions to delegate the iteration control to another iterable object (such as an array, a string, or another generator). It allows you to recursively iterate over nested iterable structures, producing a flattened sequence of values.

When you use the `yield*` expression, it essentially pauses the current generator function and starts iterating over the target iterable. It yields each value from the target iterable one by one until it is exhausted. If the target iterable itself contains other iterable objects, `yield*` will recursively delegate the iteration to those objects as well.

Here's a simple example to illustrate the usage of `yield*`:

```typescript
function* generator1() {
  yield "a";
  yield "b";
}

function* generator2() {
  yield "x";
  yield* generator1();
  yield "y";
  yield "z";
}

const gen = generator2();

console.log(gen.next()); // { value: 'x', done: false }
console.log(gen.next()); // { value: 'a', done: false }
console.log(gen.next()); // { value: 'b', done: false }
console.log(gen.next()); // { value: 'y', done: false }
console.log(gen.next()); // { value: 'z', done: false }
console.log(gen.next()); // { value: undefined, done: true }
```

In this example, `generator2()` is a generator function that yields the values `'x'`, `'y'`, and `'z'`. However, in between `'x'` and `'y'`, it delegates the iteration control to `generator1()` using `yield*`. As a result, the values `'a'` and `'b'` from `generator1()` are also included in the output.

Note that `yield*` can be used with any iterable object, not just generator functions. You can use it with arrays, strings, maps, sets, etc., as long as they implement the iterable protocol.
